## 🔧 Key Capabilities

### **Text Analysis**

- ✅ Readability scoring (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog)
- ✅ Sentiment analysis
- ✅ Linguistic complexity measurement
- ✅ Vocabulary diversity assessment
- ✅ Grammar and structure analysis

### **Performance Analytics**

- ✅ Question performance metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**

```bash
cd ml_service
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

### **Step 2: Database Configuration**

1. Update `.env` file with your MySQL credentials
2. Run the setup script to create sample data:

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

### **Step 3: Train Initial Models**

```bash
# The service will automatically train models when enough data is available
# You can also manually trigger training via API:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/train/difficulty" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model_type": "difficulty", "min_samples": 50}'
```

### **Step 4: Test the API**

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation

## 🔌 Node.js Integration

### **Install the Client Library**

```javascript
const YinizaiMLClient = require("./nodejs-integration-example");
const mlClient = new YinizaiMLClient("http://localhost:8000");
```

### **Example Usage in Your Node.js App**

```javascript
// In your question creation route
app.post("/api/questions", async (req, res) => {
  const { question_text, question_type, subject } = req.body;

  // Analyze question difficulty
  try {
    const analysis = await mlClient.analyzeQuestion({
      question_text,
      question_type,
      subject,
    });

    // Save question with predicted difficulty
    const question = await Question.create({
      ...req.body,
      predicted_difficulty: analysis.difficulty_prediction.predicted_difficulty,
      difficulty_confidence: analysis.difficulty_prediction.confidence,
    });

    res.json({ question, analysis });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("ML Analysis failed:", error);
    // Fallback: save question without ML analysis
    const question = await Question.create(req.body);
    res.json({ question });
  }
});

// In your answer submission route
app.post("/api/answers", async (req, res) => {
  const { question_id, answer_text, student_id } = req.body;

  const question = await Question.findById(question_id);

  // Analyze student answer
  const analysis = await mlClient.analyzeAnswer({
    question_text: question.question_text,
    answer_text,
    question_type: question.question_type,
    correct_answer: question.correct_answer,
  });

  // Save answer with ML predictions
  const answer = await Answer.create({
    ...req.body,
    predicted_score: analysis.score_prediction.predicted_score,
    comprehension_cluster:
      analysis.comprehension_analysis.comprehension_cluster,
  });

  res.json({ answer, analysis });
});
```
